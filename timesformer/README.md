# TimeSformer

## About This Repository

This directory is a modified version of the original TimeSformer codebase ([paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2102.05095.pdf), [official repository](https://github.com/facebookresearch/TimeSformer)).

Main modification in this fork:
- Replaced the original divided space-time attention mechanism with the DnA attention mechanism to evaluate model performance.


# Installation

First, create a conda virtual environment and activate it:
```
conda create -n timesformer python=3.7 -y
source activate timesformer
```

Then, install the following packages:

- torchvision: `pip install torchvision` or `conda install torchvision -c pytorch`
- [fvcore](https://github.com/facebookresearch/fvcore/): `pip install 'git+https://github.com/facebookresearch/fvcore'`
- simplejson: `pip install simplejson`
- einops: `pip install einops`
- timm: `pip install timm`
- PyAV: `conda install av -c conda-forge`
- psutil: `pip install psutil`
- scikit-learn: `pip install scikit-learn`
- OpenCV: `pip install opencv-python`
- tensorboard: `pip install tensorboard`

Lastly, build the TimeSformer codebase by running:
```
python setup.py build develop
```

# Usage

## Dataset Preparation

Please use the dataset preparation instructions provided in [DATASET.md](timesformer/datasets/DATASET.md).

## Training the Default TimeSformer

Training the default TimeSformer that uses divided space-time attention, and operates on 8-frame clips cropped at 224x224 spatial resolution, can be done using the following command:

```
python tools/run_net.py \
  --cfg configs/Kinetics/dna.yaml \
  DATA.PATH_TO_DATA_DIR path_to_your_dataset \
  NUM_GPUS 2 \
```
You may need to pass location of your dataset in the command line by adding `DATA.PATH_TO_DATA_DIR path_to_your_dataset`, or you can simply add

```
DATA:
  PATH_TO_DATA_DIR: path_to_your_dataset
```

To the yaml configs file, then you do not need to pass it to the command line every time.


## Training Different T

To train TimeSformer w/ DnA via Slurm, please check out our single node Slurm training script [`scripts/kinetics_dna.sh`](scripts/kinetics_dna.sh).


## Inference

Use `TRAIN.ENABLE` and `TEST.ENABLE` to control whether training or testing is required for a given run. When testing, you also have to provide the path to the checkpoint model via TEST.CHECKPOINT_FILE_PATH.
```
python tools/run_net.py \
  --cfg configs/Kinetics/dna.yaml \
  DATA.PATH_TO_DATA_DIR path_to_your_dataset \
  TEST.CHECKPOINT_FILE_PATH path_to_your_checkpoint \
  TRAIN.ENABLE False \
```

## Finetuning

To finetune from an existing PyTorch checkpoint add the following line in the command line, or you can also add it in the YAML config:

```
TRAIN.CHECKPOINT_FILE_PATH path_to_your_PyTorch_checkpoint
TRAIN.FINETUNE True
```

# Environment

The code was developed using python 3.7 on Ubuntu 20.04. For training, we used four GPU compute nodes each node containing 8 Tesla V100 GPUs (32 GPUs in total). Other platforms or GPU cards have not been fully tested.
